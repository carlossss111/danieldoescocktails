            <h2>About Daniel</h2>
            <p>I'm a Software Engineer living in the UK and I enjoy making cocktails in my spare time. For a while now I've been very into programming and cocktails so in 2019 I decided to combine both of these hobbies and make this website. My aim for the site is to make mixology accessible to everyone by giving receipes without jargon and by giving straight-forward reviews. I hope to have a place for every cocktail I try so that I always have the recipes handy.</p>

            <h2>About Cocktails</h2>
            <p>I love cocktails! I love making them as much as I love drinking them. I think that they are a great way to connect with other people and are something to talk about. Even the simplest of cocktails can stand out to the people drinking them and can often be more of a talking point than just grabbing a can of beer (though I like to do that too!).</p>
            <p>I originally took a liking to spirits much quicker than other alcohols. After getting inspired by watching various youtube videos and doing some research with books and the internet, I decided to give it a try in 2019 during a gap in my studies. My first cocktail was a Negroni which was maybe not the best choice for a first time because of the distinct bitter taste; nonetheless, I very much enjoyed it and decided I wanted to keep it going.</p>
            <p>During University I was elected as the Mixology Secretary for the University of Nottingham Cocktail Society. Every week we rented out a bar for an evening and I learned from others while they learned from me. It was a lot of fun.</p>
            <p>After graduating I've slowed down a bit, having gotten into the rabbit-hole of craft beers, but every couple months or so I still love to hold a cocktail night!</p>

            <h2>About the Website</h2>
            <p>The very first iteration of this site was written before I started education and was a simple static HTML, CSS and JavaScript site hosted by GitHub pages.</p>
            <p>After 2020 and after taking some university courses, I turned it into a classic LAMP stack site (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) which stood for five years.</p>
            <p>While there was nothing strictly wrong with the old site, in 2025 I wanted to retrofit with what I had learned from my early career in Software. The site now runs with a Python backend using PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy, and a Typescript frontend. It's now managed by Docker containers and Nginx. It finally uses HTTPS too.</p>
