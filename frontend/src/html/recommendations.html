                <h3>Harry Craddock, 1930</h3>
                <p>This was the very first content I consumed when getting into cocktails. The Youtube channel run by Ruairi Gilles has been effectively dead for two years which sucks, but the treasure trove of classic cocktails is still there and hopefully won’t be going anywhere. The videos are delivered with a clear passion for the subject matter and I’ve enjoyed making many presented by Gilles like the Penicillin and the Bee’s Knees. I don’t know if Gilles will ever make any more videos, but if he does I’d be sure to jump into them.</p>

                <h3>Chad Parkhill, 2017</h3>
                <p>This book takes you on a wonderful journey across the world featuring national alcohols and good stories of history. It’s plain to see that Parkhill hasn’t just selected cocktails made in different places, but has put a lot of effort into showcasing cocktails that are both unique and represent and represent the feeling of the region they’re from. My favourite cocktail of all time, the Jungle Bird, is featured in this book, along with others I’ve enjoyed on this site like the Pisco Sour and the Caipirihinia. The balance of regional ingredients and easy-to-find ones is well done, and there’s plenty to try for an hobbyist like me.</p>

                <h3>Cecilia Rios Murrieta, 2018</h3>
                <p>If you know me at all you know that tequila and mezcal are my favourite spirits. Tequila has a terribly bad wrap as a paintstripper-like party drink but I believe that when you try a good 100% blue agave tequila it’s like nothing else out there. Murrieta celebrates these spirits with a variety of classics, like the Margarita and Paloma, but also pushes the boat out with interesting and inventive drinks inspired by mexico in the latter parts of the book. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to dive into tequila and give it a fair shake (literally).</p>

                <h3>Dan Jones, 2016</h3>
                <p>Part of a series, I followed a lot of recipes in this book when I was first starting out. Cocktails like the Negroni, Gimlet and Gin Rickey were simple but helped me build my cabinet up bottle by bottle. Jones features a lot of information of gin too, including how to pick the perfect gin for you. The book is pleasing to read and has good tips and tricks for each cocktail.</p>

                <p>Steve has been running an engaging Youtube channel and website for a good few years and the quality has been top notch. His videos are served with a smile and many cocktails are made with readily accessible ingredients or have simple substitutes. Cocktails like the Moscow Mule and Division Bell have become my go-tos and are very easy to make. His passion really comes through in each video and his honest tasting notes are delivered light-heartedly with every drink. A pleasure to watch.</p>

                <h3>Simon Difford (Website)</h3>
                <p>Started by Simon Difford in 2001 and since having rapidly expanded, Difford’s Guide has a recipe for <em>everything</em>. The site is almost unavoidable when researching and has an extensive list of classic cocktails from different periods. The recipes are packed with extra information, such as a scale of how sweet, sour and boozy each are. Each recipe features ratings from Difford and his readers, aswell as insightful commentary. With so much in one place it can be tempting not to leave the site, but I’d say that the guide’s main strength is perhaps that it is an excellent jumping off point to dive deeper and deeper into the cocktail landscape.</p>
