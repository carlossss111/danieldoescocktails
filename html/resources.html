                    <h2>Steve the Bartender</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Steve has a massive amount of recipes on his channel that are very easy to follow and make yourself. He usually uses reasonable ingredients that are widely available everywhere. This is probably my favourite source.</p>

                </a>
                <p>This channel has a collection of top 5s and top 10s for different kinds of spirits. It has a very professional touch and it was one of the channels that got me interested in the first place.</p>

                </a>
                <p>This one is fun. I don't really watch this channel for the recipes but instead it is entertaining to watch the tricks and performances, even if I can't do any of them myself.</p>

                    <h2>Difford's Guide</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Started by Simon Difford in 2001, this website has become massive and is packed with unique recipes and reviews on different cocktails and spirits. It is also very easily navigatable and doesn't have too many ads.</p>

                    <h2>BBC Good Food</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Some of the recipes on this website are very solid and great for beginners. There is also a comment section which is helpful on finding what the average person thinks about the drink. My one issue with this website is you need adblock to tolerate it.</p>

                    <h2>Gin by Dan Jones</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Part of the "Shake, Muddle, Stir" series, this book tells you everything you need to make gin cocktails. It has many popular and many unusual recipes, aswell as a guide on how to pick the perfect gin.</p>

                </a>
                <p>Like the previous book, except for vodka! Again there is loads of popular and interesting recipes.</p>
