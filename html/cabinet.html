                    <p>Gin is one of the main spirits used in cocktails. It's predominant component is the Juniper Berry, but otherwise it can have a broad flavour profile. Popular brands of gin are availible pretty much everywhere, and there are likely (atleast in the UK) to be local brands in your area. I use Bombay, Tanqueray and a local brand Archangel, all of which have their differences but are still versatile. "London Dry" refers to the type and basically covers every gin on your average supermarket shelf.</p>

                    <p>Vodka is another extremely accomodating spirit. It's made of water and ethanol, traditionally gained by distilling potatoes. The best vodkas for cocktails have a neutral flavour, so they can be used in lots of different contexts. I use Absolut.</p>

They come in various different forms, from neutral white rums to dark and aged rums that have a much more pronounced flavour. Currently I use Barcardi Blanca, but plan on trying dark and aged rums in the near future.</p>

                    <p>Simple syrup is essential in many cocktails as it adds much needed sweetness. I make my simple syrup myself because it's much easier that way. Grab some caster sugar and water, put them in a saucepan and lightly heat and stir until dissolved. Simple syrup usually is made in a 1:1 ratio, though some recipes may differ.</p>

It has a nice swwetness and a rich coffee flavour that can be used to make stunning coffee cocktails. I love this liqueur as it is essential for my favourite cocktails. Other coffee liqueurs are availible, though this is probably the easiest to get.</p>

                    <p>Triple sec is a common orange liqueur that is necessary for many different cocktails. These can be found practically everywhere and fancier brands like Cointreau and Grand Marnier will have better pronounced flavours, though own brands will work just as well if you are on a budget.</p>

                    <p>Campari is an infusion of herbs and fruits, resulting in a very bitter flavour. After a couple of tries, the flavour really grows on you as one that makes a cocktail stand out. If you do not have access to Campari, try Aperol instead.</p>
