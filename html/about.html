            <h2>About Daniel</h2>
            <p>I am taking a gap year between sixth form and university. While I can't travel for obvious reasons, I've decided to work on a passion project that will showcase one of my favourite hobbies. I am not a real bartender by any stretch of the imagination, and I am certainly not a trained programmer, but I enjoy both on an amateur level and so am combining both of them on this website.</p>

            <h2>About Cocktails</h2>
            <p>
                I love cocktails! I love drinking them and I love making them for myself and others even more. I think they are a great way to connect with people and to have a good time. They create intrigue and interest for the people drinking them and a feeling of satisfaction for the person making them, it's great when I can see people are enjoying themselves.<br /><br />

                When I started drinking I never really got along with beer and ales that well because, let's face it, they’re not for everyone. I wanted something that I would really enjoy, so I started on cider. Yeah it was alright but I wasn’t quite there yet. So then one day at a friends house I got a bottle of Absolut Apple, now we’re going places. I liked it and having naively entered the land of spirits I tried other things until I stumbled upon my favourite spirit: gin. I brought a bottle of it to another friend's party and drank some of it straight like a madman (which I wouldn’t recommend) and then had the rest another time with some lemonade.<br /><br />

                I continued to dabble in alcohol until things kicked off about a year or two later. I can’t pinpoint what it was that made me want to start making cocktails, whether I was just bored or I saw some stuff online, I can’t remember. But one day I made my mind up that I would give it a shot and see if it was fun so I bought a big bottle of gin and had a look at some recipes. On the 25th of september 2019 I launched my cocktail instagram as a handy place to store my recipes and I started it off with a Negroni. Now I know that wasn’t the best cocktail to get started with as it is very bitter and potent and hence I wasn’t huge on it the first time round. They say in Italy it takes three times to get to like them and I think they’re right. Nonetheless, I was committed and continued with really awesome cocktails like the Bee’s Knees and the Tom Collins (along with some weird ones like the cucumber lemonade).<br /><br />

                From the start I had been making cocktails just for myself and my dad, but when I started making them for friends and having cocktail nights I started to realise the other reason why I enjoy it so much is that it is exciting to see them being made and very intriguing for the person that has never tasted it before.<br /><br />

                So that leads us to where we are now. I’m still a novice who doesn’t really know what they are doing, but I do have a lot more bottles in the cabinet than I had at the start.

            <h2>About the Website</h2>
            <p>This is just a hobby and I don't care about getting popular or making money or anything. So you may be wondering, why do I want a website? I've always been interested in computer science and I have been finding it very interesting to learn how to make websites. I set this as a project that started around mid-march and I have learned loads about HTML and CSS and soon I will know lot's about javascript aswell! So yeah, this is just a fun little project that I put together to teach myself, but I made it about something I love so I can put some real flair and passion into it, I hope you enjoy the site.</p>
