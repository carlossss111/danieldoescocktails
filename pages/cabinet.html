                    <p>Gin is one of the main spirits used in cocktails. It's predominant component is the Juniper Berry, but otherwise it can have a broad flavour profile. Popular brands of gin are availible pretty much everywhere, and there are likely (atleast in the UK) to be local brands in your area. I use Bombay, Tanqueray and a local brand Archangel, all of which have their differences but are still versatile. "London Dry" refers to the type and basically covers every gin on your average supermarket shelf.</p>

                    <p>Vodka is another extremely accommodating spirit. It's made of water and ethanol, traditionally gained by distilling potatoes. The best vodkas for cocktails have a neutral flavour, so they can be used in lots of different contexts. I use Absolut.</p>

They come in various different forms, from neutral white rums to dark and aged rums that have a much more pronounced flavour. Currently I use Barcardi Blanca, but plan on trying dark and aged rums in the near future.</p>

                    <p>Simple syrup is essential in many cocktails as it adds much needed sweetness. I make my simple syrup myself because it's much easier that way. Grab some caster sugar and water, put them in a saucepan and lightly heat and stir until dissolved. Simple syrup usually is made in a 1:1 ratio, though some recipes may differ.</p>

                    <p>Bitters are a fantastic addition to practically any cocktail you make, even if they are not in the original recipe. These bitters have a variety of herbs and spices found in Trinidad, and they add a distinct taste to a cocktail. A few dashes and you are set.</p>

                    <p>Kahlúa is the coffee liqueur that I use and it's found in every supermarket. It has a nice swwetness and a rich coffee flavour that can be used to make stunning coffee cocktails. I love this liqueur as it is essential for my favourite cocktails. Other coffee liqueurs are availible, though this is probably the easiest to get.</p>

                    <p>Triple sec is a common orange liqueur that is necessary for many different cocktails. These can be found practically everywhere and fancier brands like Cointreau and Grand Marnier will have better pronounced flavours, though own brands will work just as well if you are on a budget.</p>

                    <p>This is a Japanese melon liqueur. It has a good taste and is featured in many cocktails as the main ingredient, sometimes without another main spirit. It is also popularly used for riffs on well-known cocktails, like the Tokyo Iced Tea.</p>

                    <p>A very handy sugar syrup. The main use for this syrup is to alter the colour of the cocktail to be more red, though it features a pomegranate flavour aswell. It can be used in lots of different cocktails like a version of the Cosmopolitan.</p>

                    <p>Campari is an infusion of herbs and fruits, resulting in a very bitter flavour. After a couple of tries, the flavour really grows on you as one that makes a cocktail stand out. If you do not have access to Campari, try Aperol instead.</p>

                    <p>Tonic water is brilliant for a cheeky G&amp;T when you don't feel like making anything crazy. A premium tonic like Fevertree makes all the difference, as tonic makes up the largest part of the drink.</p>
