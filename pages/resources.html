                        <h2>Steve the Bartender</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Steve has a gargantuan number of recipes both on his youtube channel and on his website. He seems to have been doing this for a long time so is very experienced, but at the same time never makes things overly complicated. His recipes are very easy to follow and almost always use accessible ingredients or atleast mention viable substitions. Definitely recommended for all abilities.</p>

                        <h2>Bonneville Cocktails</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>This was the channel that got me interested in making cocktails in the first place. The host Ruairi's youtube channel mostly has top fives and top tens categorised by different spirits. The channel is edited well and is very appealing, demonstrating how cocktail making can be done with flair. The recipes are very impressive and punchy.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>Started by Simon Difford in 2001, this website has become massive and is packed with unique recipes and reviews on different cocktails and spirits. The recipes are packed with extra information like a scale on how sweet/sour they are and how boozy they are, as just one example. The site makes it very easy to find new recipes with lists like it's "World's top 100 cocktails" and with features like advanced search. With this, you can find a cocktail of anything imaginable. The site also has other features, like a page on people & personalities, a page with different bars and even an in-built online shop.</p>

                        <h2>Gin by Dan Jones</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Part of the "Shake, Muddle, Stir" series, this book tells you everything you need to make gin cocktails. It has many popular and many unusual recipes, aswell as a guide on how to pick the perfect gin. The commentaries are insightful and the illustrations are helpful. I highly recommend this when starting out.</p>
