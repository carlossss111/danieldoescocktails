            <h2>About Daniel</h2>
            <p>I'm a student at the University of Nottingham and am on the committee for it’s Cocktail Society. I’m super into programming and cocktails so I decided to combine both of those hobbies and make this website. My aim for this site is to to make the mixology accessible for anyone who has never tried it before by giving recipes without jargon and by giving honest reviews. I also hope to have a place for every cocktail I try so I never forget them.</p>

            <h2>About Cocktails</h2>
            <p>I love cocktails! I love making them as much as I love drinking them. I think that they are a great way to connect with other people and to have a good time. Even the simplest of cocktails often impress the people drinking them and are much more intriguing and interesting then just grabbing a beer (though that’s fine too!).</p>
            <p>I’ve always enjoyed spirits more than other alcohols, but as I’m sure you know that you don’t always want to drink them straight. After getting inspired by watching various youtube videos and doing some research with books and the internet, I decided to give it a try in 2019 during my gap-year. My first cocktail was a Negroni, maybe not the best choice for a first cocktail because of the bitter taste. Nonetheless, I very much enjoyed it and decided I wanted to keep it going.</p>
            <p>If I’m at home at Norwich I love to make cocktails for myself and my Dad on Sunday nights and when I’m away I love to host cocktail nights with friends and acquaintances. Sharing this hobby with other people is the highlight of it, it’s always been fantastic fun.</p>
            <p>In May 2021 I was elected as the Mixology Secretary for the University of Nottingham Cocktail Society.</p>

            <h2>About the Website</h2>
            <p>When I first started this hobby I only had my Instagram to store and share my recipes. When my gap-year was partly ruined by Covid, I decided to use all that free time to make my own website. I taught myself how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript and hosted the website on GitHub pages.</p>
            <p>In 2020 I left for university to take a degree in Computer Science and I learned lots and lots more. With my new-found knowledge, I now have added PHP, have started hosting the site myself and have cleaned up my code under better conventions.</p>
