            <h2>About Daniel</h2>
            <p>In 2019 I took a gap year between sixth form and university so I could go travelling. During my time off, I became very interested in mixology and I wanted to share that with people. So I combined this new hobby with my old hobby, programming, and I developed this website. I am not a real bartender by any stretch of the imagination, but I hope this website will show my journey as an amateur cocktail maker and will show people how they can get involved.</p>

            <h2>About Cocktails</h2>
            <p>I love cocktails! I love drinking them and I love making them. I think that they are a great way to connect with other people and have a good time. Even the simplest of cocktails often impress the people drinking them and are much more intriguing and interesting then grabbing a beer.</p>
            <p>When I first started drinking alcohol, I never took a liking to beer and ales. One of the first spirits I remember drinking was Absolut Apple Vodka one night. I liked the taste so started trying other spirits like gin and rum (though I’m not an alcoholic I swear!). Since I had found my drinks of choice, I wanted to make them more interesting so I bought a shaker and some liqueurs with the plan of making cocktails. The first cocktail I ever made was a Negroni; I enjoyed searching for the recipe and making it, so I continued with all the cocktails you see on this website.</p>
            <p>Initially, I had been making cocktails for myself and my Dad, but soon I started making them for my friends as well. I’ve had many cocktail nights which have always been the highlight of this hobby, sharing my creations with my friends has always been fantastic fun.</p>
            <p>While I might still be a novice in this hobby, I hope that will at least provide an encouraging perspective for anyone interested in making cocktails.</p>

            <h2>About the Website</h2>
            <p>When I first started this hobby I created an Instagram page where I share each and every new cocktail I encounter. When, in my gap year, I took courses on website development I decided to make a website to practise what I have learned. I then decided to make it about my favourite hobby and use my cocktail recipes already stored on Instagram to get started. This website is not for monetary gains or popularity, it is simply for practise and to share with my friends and acquaintances. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
