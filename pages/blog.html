            <h2>Getting started from nothing.<span style="float:right;">18/05/20</span></h2>
            <p>In spirit of this amateur website, this first blog post will be about getting started from nothing. It can be quite daunting if you want to start making cocktails because many recipes you may look at might have ingredients you don’t have yet or you haven’t heard of altogether. They might use tools you don’t have either, perhaps you don’t even have a shaker yet.</p>
            <p>Still, don’t be deterred, here is a short guide. If you don’t have any already, I would first start by buying a single spirit like Vodka, Gin, Rum, Tequila or Bourbon and going from there. I myself started with a single bottle of Gin, which opened the door to a huge amount of cocktail opportunities that were inexpensive because many recipes only need that one spirit as the main pricey ingredient.</p>
            <p>Once you have bought your chosen spirit then it’s time to look for recipes.  You want to look for 3-5 ingredient recipes that don’t have many fancy liqueurs and instead focus on cheap ingredients like lemons or (home-made) simple syrup. This hobby can be expensive, so starting cheap and building your way up is probably the best way to go. If you don’t have a shaker, I would recommend buying one (some a very reasonably priced) however if you’re not ready to do that yet, you can either use a jam jar or you can simply look for recipes which are stirred (not shaken), of which there are many.</p>
            <p>If you’d like any suggestions, suitable starter cocktails for Gin might be the Bee’s Knees which uses home-made honey syrup, the Gin Rickey or the Gin and Jam. For Vodka you might want to start with a Moscow Mule and for Rum you might start with a Honeysuckle Daiquiri. All are very inexpensive and taste great.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve got your recipe and ingredients (and an unexpectedly large amount of ice cubes) then you can go ahead and make it. If you haven’t got much glassware then the glass you serve it in doesn’t hugely matter, just make sure you garnish it somehow. And there you have it, you've made your first cocktail relatively cheaply and easily, enjoy!</p>
