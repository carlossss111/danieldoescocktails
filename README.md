My first front-end development project. It is a website where I store a table of all of the cocktails I have created, share resources and write to a blog.

## Pages
* __/index.html__ contains a short description of the website, then a table with all recipes.
    * Uses __/scripts/nav.js__ and __/scripts/navdisplay.js__ for the navigation bar (like all pages.)
    * Uses __/scripts/tablesearch.js__ to search .ingredients classes and the h2 tags in each table row.
    * Uses __/scripts/tableTabs.js__ to show and hide to two different recipe table tags.
    * Uses __/scripts/units.js__ to switch between metric and imperial by using `.split("ml")` on each ingredient row.
* __/pages/about.html__ describes mysely and my hobbies.
* __/pages/cabinet.html__ lists all of the liquid ingredients I use.
* __/pages/resources.html__ lists all of the resources I use on a regular basis.
* __/pages/blog.html__ is my blog.
All of the pages also use __/css/style.css__ for general stylings and other files matching their name in __/css__ for specific stylings.

## Usage
You might want to use code from tablesearch.js or units.js but I'm just an amateur so you can probably find cleaner code online.

In short, use my code if you want (just not the images and cocktail commentary obviously).

## To Do
* Mark recipes as personal favourites.
* Sort cabinet by type of ingredient.
* Update blog, perhaps with showcases on different ingredients.
* Push more on social media.
