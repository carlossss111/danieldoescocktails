Most times I suggest this to people I get lots of "milk <em>and</em> alcohol - wuuuuuh!?" but trust me atleast try it once. It's like an iced coffee but with alcohol, what more could you ask for? The amount of Kahúa can be adjusted depending on how sweet you want it and you can even use half heavy cream half milk if you have it on hand. Give this one a go, I keep coming back to it and I can't wait to try some variations on it when I get more ingredients.<span class="date">15/12/19</span></p>

                <p>Super easy to make and a pretty famous cocktail. The Tom Collins is probably the most popular Collins recipe and is good at adding a bit of sweetness to your gin and lengthening with soda. It's easy to see why it's so popular when you taste it, can't really go wrong.<span class="date">06/10/19</span></p>

                <p>Considering theres only 3 ingredients, this cocktail is wild! I'd recommend making a big bottle of honey syrup because you're going to want to make this often. It has perfect sweetness and allows your chosen gin to take center stage whilst maintaining a noticable note of honey and lemon. Fantastic.<span class="date">29/09/19</span></p>

                <p>The first proper cocktail I've ever made. The negroni is very famous in Italy and elsewhere and they say that you need to drink it thrice before you start to like it. It is very bitter but has a distinct taste. This cocktail is very respectable and there are many different variants on it to check out. I wouldn't recommend it as your first cocktail because of the bitterness and potency and the fact you have to buy 3 expensive spirits, but I would definitely recommend it once you get things moving.<span class="date">25/09/19</span></p>
