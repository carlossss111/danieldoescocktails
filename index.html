Tequila is made from the Agave plant, so the addition of the Agave syrup seriously compliments the drink and brings out that flavour.

This cocktail packs a summer punch that is sure to take anyone who drinks it straight to the Carribean, even those like me in dreary old England. This cocktail is a very popular classic so there are many variations; for example if you do not have access to a blender, change the recipe to 45ml of both lime juice and coconut milk and 15ml of lime juice and shake into a glass full of crushed ice. That is just one variation of many.<span class="date">07/06/20</span></p>

Well it's actually very delicious, rich and of-course has Angostura's signature notes of cinnamon and other herbs and spices. It's also balanced really well with the sour and sweet components and worked much better than I thought it would.

This cocktail is very respectable and there are many different variants on it to check out. I wouldn't recommend it as your first cocktail because of the bitterness and potency and the fact you have to buy 3 expensive spirits, but I would definitely recommend it once you get things moving.<span class="date">25/09/19</span></p>

                    <p class="description">A super sweet and refreshing cocktail. This one will always bring great memories as I had it when transiting on my way back from my holiday in New Zealand. If you ever pass through this airport, makesure to visit the Cactus garden as it is a great place to escape from the crowds and enjoy yourself a nice cocktail.<span class="date">23/01/20</span></p>

                    <p class="description">This cocktail was really nice and had notes of apple and citrus, it was very good in accompanying and complementing the Indian currys served at this restaurant. I'll admit this one is a bit of a flex but I promise I don't do fancy stuff like this all the time. <span class="date">12/12/19</span></p>

                    <p class="description">While most people know the Long island iced tea, which uses cola and a bunch of different spirits, the Tokyo island iced tea instead swaps out the cola for Midori, a melon based liqueur. It's got a brilliant sweet and fruity taste and it's just wonderful. Mr Postles is also a great bar that gets pretty wild and is great for either pre-drinks or the main event.<span class="date">17/11/19</span></p>
